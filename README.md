# What is Blamer?
Blamer is a tool written in Python that translates all comments in a code file into the desired language. Blamer uses the Google Translate library to translate comments.

For the moment, Blamer only detects comments starting with // or multi-line comments surrounded by /* and */ but it is planned for future versions to add other parameters.

With Blamer you can release your malware into the wild while blaming another country. Why? Because it's cool.

# Requirements
To use Blamer, you'll need additional libraries. You can install them by typing `pip3 install requirements.txt`.
